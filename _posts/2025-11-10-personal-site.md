## GitHub Pages

I created my personal site using GitHub Pages, which offers free hosting for static sites.

GitHub Pages natively supports the following languages:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript/TypeScript (via Node.js)
- Ruby (via Jekyll)
- Go (via Hugo)
- Python (via MkDocs or Pelican)

### Setup from Minimal Mistakes Template

1. Visit **[mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter)**
2. Click "Use this template"
3. Make the repository public
4. Name it `<your-github-username>.github.io`
5. Use VS Code to edit your site

Here is the full [quickstart](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/). The template uses Ruby and Jekyll which you will need to install on your computer to edit in VSCode.

## Vercel + Vibe Coding

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) offers a free tier to host small sites built with JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, and Next.js. Their templates enable you to launch a site in minutes. Vercel also allows easy access to your codebase through VSCode and you will need to install Node.js. Next.js is a module published on npm (Node.js Package Manager) so it's installed using "npm install".

Instead of using their generic templates, I would recommend vibe coding, which is directing an AI to code for you. [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) offers a free tier and creates very custom sites, but takes a while to master. The easiest option is using a personal website generator. [Typefolio](https://www.typefolio.xyz/)  writes content for you based on your resume. [Nextfolio](https://znaxnor.github.io/PortfolioWebsite/) deploys a less generic template to Vercel in seconds and directs you to write the text content of the site including images, math expressions, X and YouTube embeds, and Markdown.
