# How to Get a Data Analyst Job

Landing your first data analyst role doesn't require luck—it requires strategy. Here's my proven approach for new graduates navigating today's competitive market.

## 1. Craft an Outstanding Resume

While countless resume guides exist online, the most valuable advice I can offer is simple: **get human feedback**. Find someone experienced to review your resume and guide you toward writing precisely the right bullet points. Their perspective can transform good content into compelling achievements.

## 2. Optimize Your LinkedIn Profile

Your LinkedIn should mirror your resume exactly—every job description and degree detail should match perfectly. Since you've already polished your resume wording, this consistency ensures recruiters see the same professional narrative everywhere.

**Quick LinkedIn wins:**
- Add a professional profile photo and banner image
- Connect with classmates, friends, and recruiters
- **Avoid the Jobs tab**—it's mostly spam
- Remove phrases like "sophomore" or "looking for an internship" when transitioning to full-time roles

## 3. Use Jobright.AI (Skip Traditional Job Boards)

Stop wasting time on Google, Indeed, or LinkedIn's job search. **[Jobright.AI](https://jobright.ai/)** is significantly better for finding relevant opportunities.

**Setup checklist:**
- Log in with your Google account
- Upload your resume and complete your profile
- Install the Jobright Chrome Extension
- Use the green "Edit Filters" button extensively

**Search strategy:** Don't limit yourself to "Data Analyst." Include related titles like:
- BI Analyst, CRM Analyst
- Operations, Business, Strategy, Planning, Financial Analyst
- Product Manager roles

Look for "new grad" in titles, but don't require it.

## 4. Leverage GitHub

Create a GitHub account using your personal email, then download **[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** and **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**.

Upload any school projects involving code—R, HTML, Python, or any programming language. Follow an LLM's guidance if needed. **One repository per project.** For technical business roles, having visible code projects demonstrates practical skills that set you apart.

## 5. Master Kilo Code

**[Kilo Code](https://kilocode.ai/)** is a game-changing AI coding assistant that significantly outperforms basic LLMs for development tasks.

**Quick setup:**
1. Create a free account and download the VS Code extension
2. Follow the documentation to add your API key to VS Code
3. Set the model to "Minimax M2" for free usage
4. If you struggle with setup, reach out for help

Kilo Code functions as an intelligent "agent" that handles complex coding tasks more effectively than traditional alternatives.

## 6. Build a GitHub Pages Site

Creating a professional website is easier than you think, especially with Kilo Code's assistance.

**Step-by-step setup:**
1. Visit **[mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter)**
2. Click "Use this template"
3. Make the repository public
4. Name it `<your-github-username>.github.io`
5. Use VS Code to edit your site

**Why GitHub Pages?**
- Free hosting (though it doesn't support Node.js)
- Professional presentation
- Easy to maintain

**Resume integration:** Add your resume using a simple `<iframe>` or copy the PDF viewer approach from [my site](https://optimalcharb.github.io/) by examining the [HTML structure](https://github.com/optimalcharb/optimalcharb.github.io/blob/main/index.html).

**Cross-promotion:** Include your GitHub Pages link on LinkedIn and add both LinkedIn and GitHub.io links to your resume.

## 7. Complete a Side Project

Formal education doesn't cover everything. Kilo Code can quickly set up Python-based data analysis projects using any dataset.

**Project strategy:**
- Choose an API from the **[Public APIs repository](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)**
- If Kilo Code struggles, provide documentation details
- Use the prompt enhancement feature to expand "create an extensive data analysis report of this API {link}" into a comprehensive prompt

Real-world projects demonstrate initiative and give you concrete examples to discuss in interviews.
